## Anopaper - anonymous notes service

## AnoPaper allows you to save and share notes anonymously.

### Functionality:

- Notes support markdown format. For example, the entry: `### Level 3 Heading` would look like this:

> ### Level 3 heading

**Mathjax syntax is also supported** For example: `$\sum{i=1}^n i^2$` would look like this: $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$

- Public notes are available only by link.
- When you click on the link, the note is saved locally and deleted from the server.
- Non-public notes are saved locally and are not sent to the server.`
